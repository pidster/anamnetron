## What's Working Now

```
svt import design/architecture.yaml     # Load a design model
svt check                                # Conformance check (design-only)
svt analyze .                            # Analyze Rust + TypeScript + Go + Python project
svt check --analysis                     # Compare design vs analysis
svt export --format mermaid              # Export as Mermaid flowchart
svt export --format json                 # Export as interchange JSON
svt export --format dot                  # Export as DOT (Graphviz)
svt export --format svg -o arch.svg      # Export as SVG (requires Graphviz)
svt export --format png -o arch.png      # Export as PNG (requires Graphviz)
svt export --format mermaid -o arch.mmd  # Export to file
svt diff --from 1 --to 2                 # Compare two snapshots (human output)
svt diff --from 1 --to 2 --format json   # Compare two snapshots (JSON output)
svt-server --design design/architecture.yaml --project .
                                         # Serve API + web UI at http://localhost:3000
```

The web UI renders the architecture graph with compound nodes, click-to-inspect node details, search, layout switching (force-directed / hierarchical), conformance overlay, and diff view overlay for comparing snapshots. With WASM loaded, node detail lookups and search run entirely in the browser — zero API round-trips after initial snapshot load.

All 12 constraints in `design/architecture.yaml` are fully evaluated in both design-only and full conformance mode — zero `NotEvaluable`. Dog-food conformance: 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 warned, 0 not evaluable. There are 10 unimplemented design nodes (expected — some are future work like `/svt/web`) and ~518 undocumented analysis nodes (expected — analysis is much more granular than the design model).

## Known Gaps

### Analyzer Wiring — RESOLVED
- ~~`AnalyzerRegistry` exists (M10) but `analyze_project()` still hardcodes the Rust and TypeScript phases directly rather than dispatching through the registry.~~ Resolved by introducing `LanguageOrchestrator` trait with `OrchestratorRegistry`-based dispatch. `analyze_project()` now iterates over registered orchestrators with a uniform discover-analyse-postprocess pipeline. Four orchestrators implemented: Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python.

### Canonical Path Alignment — RESOLVED (M11)
- ~~4 dog-food constraints were "not evaluable" in conformance mode.~~ Fixed by workspace-aware canonical path mapping (`svt-core` → `svt::core` → `/svt/core`) and enum variant extraction. All 12 constraints now pass.

### Analysis Depth — PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- ~~The analyzer extracts crate/module/type/function structure but does not resolve cross-crate call graphs, method calls, or trait implementations.~~ `self.method()` calls inside `impl` blocks are now resolved by propagating the impl type through the tree-sitter walk (e.g., `self.baz()` inside `impl Foo` resolves to `Foo::baz`). Methods in impl blocks are parented under their type in the containment hierarchy. Non-self method calls (`x.foo()`) and cross-crate calls remain unresolved (~20 file-level warning summaries). This limits the accuracy of dependency-direction constraints for non-self calls.

### Export Formats — RESOLVED (M16)
- ~~Mermaid, JSON, and DOT are implemented. SVG/PNG rendering could be added via Graphviz CLI piping or embedded renderer.~~ SVG and PNG export added via Graphviz CLI piping (`SvgExporter`, `PngExporter`). All five formats (Mermaid, JSON, DOT, SVG, PNG) available.

### Web UI — RESOLVED (M16)
- ~~No dark mode, no persistence of layout/filter state, no URL routing/permalinks.~~ Dark/light theme toggle, hash-based URL routing, localStorage persistence, keyboard shortcuts, and diff view overlay all implemented.

### Additional Languages — PARTIALLY RESOLVED (M15)
- ~~Only Rust and TypeScript analyzers exist.~~ Go and Python analyzers added in M15 with tree-sitter grammars. Java and other languages remain as future goals (PRINCIPLES.md: Extensibility).

### Git Integration — RESOLVED (M13 + M16)
- ~~`analyze_project()` accepts an optional `commit_ref` but there is no automatic git-aware snapshot creation or change detection.~~ `svt analyze` now auto-detects git HEAD when `--commit-ref` is not provided. Change detection between snapshots is available via `svt diff`. Web UI diff view overlay added in M16.

### Dynamic Plugin Loading
- Plugin registries exist with `.register()` API but all plugins are compiled in. No external plugin discovery, no dynamic loading, no plugin manifest format.

## Suggested Next Milestones

### Milestone 11: Canonical Path Alignment — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix the 4 not-evaluable dog-food constraints by aligning analysis canonical paths with the design model.

**Delivered:**
- Workspace name detection from common crate name prefix (`svt-core`, `svt-cli` → workspace `svt`)
- Workspace-aware qualified name mapping (`svt-core` → `svt::core` → `/svt/core`)
- Workspace root node emission (`/svt` as `System`/`workspace`)
- Enum variant extraction via tree-sitter (enabling `must_contain` constraints)
- Binary target naming fix (always use package name, not target name)
- **Result: 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 warned, 0 not evaluable**

**Not yet done (deferred):** ~~`AnalyzerRegistry`-based dispatch~~ — Resolved in post-M15 gap cleanup via `LanguageOrchestrator` trait and `OrchestratorRegistry`.

### Milestone 12: DOT Export — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add DOT (Graphviz) export format through the `ExportRegistry`.

**Delivered:**
- `DotExporter` implementing `ExportFormat` trait with `subgraph cluster_*` containment
- Labelled directed edges for non-containment relationships
- Registered in `ExportRegistry::with_defaults()` — CLI picks it up automatically
- 3 unit tests + 1 snapshot test + 1 CLI integration test
- `svt export --format dot` works out of the box

**Not yet done (deferred):** ~~SVG rendering could be added via Graphviz CLI piping or an embedded renderer.~~ Resolved in M16 with `SvgExporter` and `PngExporter`.

### Milestone 13: Snapshot Diffing + Git Integration — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Enable comparing two analysis snapshots and integrate with git for automatic version tracking.

**Delivered:**
- Core diff engine: nodes matched by canonical path, edges by (source, target, kind) tuple
- `SnapshotDiff` with `NodeChange`, `EdgeChange`, `DiffSummary` types (Serialize + Deserialize)
- `svt diff --from V1 --to V2` with human-readable and JSON output
- `GET /api/diff?from=V1&to=V2` server endpoint
- Git HEAD auto-detection in `svt analyze` (shells out to `git rev-parse HEAD`)
- 9 core diff tests + 2 CLI integration tests + 2 server tests

**Not yet done (deferred):** ~~Web UI diff view — highlight added/removed/changed nodes in graph overlay.~~ Resolved in M16.

### Milestone 14: Web UI Polish — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Improve the web frontend with dark mode, persistence, URL routing, and better UX.

**Delivered:**
- Dark/light theme toggle with CSS custom properties and localStorage persistence
- Theme-aware Cytoscape graph (colors adapt to light/dark mode)
- Hash-based URL routing (`#v=1&node=id&layout=dagre`) with back/forward support
- localStorage persistence for layout preference and theme
- Keyboard navigation: Escape to close panels, `f` to fit-all
- Loading spinner animation and improved empty state messaging
- `getDiff` API client function and `SnapshotDiff` TypeScript types
- 13 new router tests + 1 new API test = 19 total vitest tests

**Not yet done (deferred):** Error boundary components with retry, ~~diff view overlay in graph~~ (resolved in M16), arrow-key graph traversal.

### Milestone 15: Additional Language Analyzers — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add Go and Python analyzers through the `AnalyzerRegistry`.

**Delivered:**
- `GoAnalyzer` with tree-sitter-go: function, method (with receiver type), struct, interface, type alias, import extraction
- `PythonAnalyzer` with tree-sitter-python: class, function, method, decorated definition, import/import-from extraction
- Go module discovery via `go.mod` with package directory walking (excludes `vendor/`, `_test.go`)
- Python package discovery via `pyproject.toml` [project] name and `setup.py` name= fallback (excludes venv, .venv, __pycache__)
- Both registered in `AnalyzerRegistry::with_defaults()`
- 6-phase analysis pipeline: Rust → TypeScript → Go → Python → Mapping → Insertion
- 14 new analyzer unit tests (7 Go + 7 Python), 7 new discovery tests
- CLI output updated to show Go module and Python package counts

**Not yet done (deferred):** Java and other languages not yet supported.

### Known Gaps Cleanup (Post-M15)

**Goal:** Clean up three known gaps before proceeding to the next milestone.

**Delivered:**
- `LanguageOrchestrator` trait with `OrchestratorRegistry` — uniform discover-analyse-postprocess pipeline replacing hardcoded per-language phases in `analyze_project()`
- Four orchestrators: `RustOrchestrator`, `TypeScriptOrchestrator`, `GoOrchestrator`, `PythonOrchestrator`
- TypeScript orchestrator handles complex post-processing (item reparenting, import resolution) via `emit_structural_items()` and `post_process()` overrides
- Rust orchestrator handles workspace root emission via `extra_items()` override
- Method-call warning aggregation: one summary per file instead of ~3,500 individual warnings
- Project root validation in `analyze_project()` for better error reporting

### Milestone 16: Web UI Diff View + SVG/PNG Export — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add diff overlay visualization to the web UI and SVG/PNG export via Graphviz CLI piping.

**Delivered:**
- `SvgExporter` and `PngExporter` implementing `ExportFormat` trait, piping DOT through `dot -Tsvg`/`dot -Tpng`
- PNG binary handling in CLI (`--output` required, writes raw bytes)
- Graceful error when Graphviz `dot` is not installed
- Diff overlay on Cytoscape graph: `.diff-added` (green dashed), `.diff-removed` (red dashed, faded), `.diff-changed` (amber dashed)
- "Compare to..." dropdown in toolbar for selecting comparison snapshot
- Diff summary banner showing added/removed/changed node counts
- `diff` parameter in URL hash routing for permalinks (`#v=2&diff=1`)
- Diff state in graph store (`diffReport`, `diffVersion`, `clearDiff()`)
- 2 new Rust export tests + 3 new vitest router tests
- **Result: 349 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 371 total**

### Milestone 17: Dynamic Plugin Loading

**Goal:** Support external plugins loaded at runtime from the filesystem.

**Scope:**
- Plugin manifest format (`svt-plugin.toml` or similar)
- Filesystem discovery conventions (`~/.svt/plugins/`, project-local `.svt/plugins/`)
- Dynamic loading via `libloading` for Rust dylib plugins
- CLI `svt plugin list|install|remove` commands
- Security considerations: plugin sandboxing, version compatibility
