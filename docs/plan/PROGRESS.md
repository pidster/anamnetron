                                         # Serve API + web UI at http://localhost:3000
svt-server --store .svt/store            # Serve with persistent storage (data survives restart)
svt-server --store .svt/store --design design/architecture.yaml
                                         # Persistent store + fresh design import at startup
```

The web UI renders the architecture graph with compound nodes, click-to-inspect node details, search, layout switching (force-directed / hierarchical), conformance overlay, diff view overlay, error boundaries with retry, arrow-key graph traversal, and a filtering sidebar for node/edge/sub-kind/language filtering. With WASM loaded, node detail lookups and search run entirely in the browser — zero API round-trips after initial snapshot load.

All 12 constraints in `design/architecture.yaml` are fully evaluated in both design-only and full conformance mode — zero `NotEvaluable`. Dog-food conformance: 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 warned, 0 not evaluable. There are 10 unimplemented design nodes (expected — some are future work like `/svt/web`) and ~518 undocumented analysis nodes (expected — analysis is much more granular than the design model).

## Known Gaps

### Analyzer Wiring — RESOLVED
- ~~`AnalyzerRegistry` exists (M10) but `analyze_project()` still hardcodes the Rust and TypeScript phases directly rather than dispatching through the registry.~~ Resolved by introducing `LanguageOrchestrator` trait with `OrchestratorRegistry`-based dispatch. `analyze_project()` now iterates over registered orchestrators with a uniform discover-analyse-postprocess pipeline. Four orchestrators implemented: Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python.

### Canonical Path Alignment — RESOLVED (M11)
- ~~4 dog-food constraints were "not evaluable" in conformance mode.~~ Fixed by workspace-aware canonical path mapping (`svt-core` → `svt::core` → `/svt/core`) and enum variant extraction. All 12 constraints now pass.

### Analysis Depth — PARTIALLY RESOLVED (M21)
- ~~The analyzer extracts crate/module/type/function structure but does not resolve cross-crate call graphs, method calls, or trait implementations.~~ `self.method()` calls inside `impl` blocks are resolved by propagating the impl type through the tree-sitter walk. `Self::method()` and local `Type::method()` associated function calls are resolved via scope-aware rewriting. Heuristic local variable type inference resolves method calls on variables with known types (explicit annotations, constructor patterns like `Foo::new()`, struct expressions, function parameters including `&`/`&mut` stripping). Crate-level `Depends` edges are extracted from Cargo metadata workspace dependencies. Dog-food: 468 of 3997 method calls resolved (11.7%). Chained calls (`x.foo().bar()`), trait objects, generics, closures, and cross-function type flow remain unresolved.

### Export Formats — RESOLVED (M16)
- ~~Mermaid, JSON, and DOT are implemented. SVG/PNG rendering could be added via Graphviz CLI piping or embedded renderer.~~ SVG and PNG export added via Graphviz CLI piping (`SvgExporter`, `PngExporter`). All five formats (Mermaid, JSON, DOT, SVG, PNG) available.

### Web UI — RESOLVED (M16 + M23)
- ~~No dark mode, no persistence of layout/filter state, no URL routing/permalinks.~~ Dark/light theme toggle, hash-based URL routing, localStorage persistence, keyboard shortcuts, diff view overlay, error boundaries with retry, arrow-key graph traversal, and filtering sidebar all implemented.

### Additional Languages — PARTIALLY RESOLVED (M15)
- ~~Only Rust and TypeScript analyzers exist.~~ Go and Python analyzers added in M15 with tree-sitter grammars. Java and other languages remain as future goals (PRINCIPLES.md: Extensibility).

### Git Integration — RESOLVED (M13 + M16)
- ~~`analyze_project()` accepts an optional `commit_ref` but there is no automatic git-aware snapshot creation or change detection.~~ `svt analyze` now auto-detects git HEAD when `--commit-ref` is not provided. Change detection between snapshots is available via `svt diff`. Web UI diff view overlay added in M16.

### Dynamic Plugin Loading — RESOLVED (M17 + M22)
- ~~Plugin registries exist with `.register()` API but all plugins are compiled in. No external plugin discovery, no dynamic loading, no plugin manifest format.~~ Resolved: `SvtPlugin` trait + `declare_plugin!` macro, `PluginLoader` with `libloading`, `--plugin` flag, `svt plugin list`, 3-tier discovery (CLI/project-local/user-global). ~~Plugin manifest format (`svt-plugin.toml`) and install/remove commands remain as future work.~~ Resolved in M22: `svt-plugin.toml` manifest format, `svt plugin install|remove|info` commands, manifest-aware loading with source tracking, plugin authoring documentation.

### Plugin Analyzer Support — RESOLVED (M18)
- ~~`LanguageOrchestrator` lives in svt-analyzer; plugins depend on svt-core only. External plugins cannot contribute language analyzers.~~ Resolved: `LanguageDescriptor` struct + `LanguageParser` trait in svt-core (WASM-compatible), `DescriptorOrchestrator` adapter in svt-analyzer, `SvtPlugin::language_parsers()` method. Go, Python, TypeScript refactored to descriptor+parser pattern. Plugin language contributions wired into CLI analysis pipeline via `analyze_project_with_registry()`.

### Store Persistence — RESOLVED (M19)
- ~~The server always uses `CozoStore::new_in_memory()`, losing all data on restart. No schema migration system, no store management CLI commands, no way to inspect or compact the store.~~ Resolved: Schema version + migration framework (`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `schema_version()`, `migrate()`), `store_info()` with per-snapshot node/edge counts, `svt store info|compact|reset` CLI commands, `--store` flag for server persistent CozoDB storage, `GET /api/store/info` endpoint.

### Incremental Analysis — RESOLVED (M20)
- ~~Each `svt analyze` run re-parses every source file. For large codebases this is wasteful when only a few files changed.~~ Resolved: BLAKE3 content hashing for file change detection, `file_manifest` CozoDB relation storing per-file hashes grouped by language unit, `copy_nodes`/`copy_edges` store methods for carrying forward unchanged data, unit-level skip with copy-then-upsert strategy, `svt analyze --incremental` CLI flag with auto-detection of latest analysis version as previous.

## Suggested Next Milestones

### Known Gaps Cleanup (Post-M15)

**Goal:** Clean up three known gaps before proceeding to the next milestone.

**Delivered:**
- `LanguageOrchestrator` trait with `OrchestratorRegistry` — uniform discover-analyse-postprocess pipeline replacing hardcoded per-language phases in `analyze_project()`
- Four orchestrators: `RustOrchestrator`, `TypeScriptOrchestrator`, `GoOrchestrator`, `PythonOrchestrator`
- TypeScript orchestrator handles complex post-processing (item reparenting, import resolution) via `emit_structural_items()` and `post_process()` overrides
- Rust orchestrator handles workspace root emission via `extra_items()` override
- Method-call warning aggregation: one summary per file instead of ~3,500 individual warnings
- Project root validation in `analyze_project()` for better error reporting

### Milestone 16: Web UI Diff View + SVG/PNG Export — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add diff overlay visualization to the web UI and SVG/PNG export via Graphviz CLI piping.

**Delivered:**
- `SvgExporter` and `PngExporter` implementing `ExportFormat` trait, piping DOT through `dot -Tsvg`/`dot -Tpng`
- PNG binary handling in CLI (`--output` required, writes raw bytes)

- `declare_plugin!` macro generating `extern "C" fn svt_plugin_create()` entry point
- `PluginError` enum (`LoadFailed`, `SymbolNotFound`, `ApiVersionMismatch`) with `thiserror`
- `PluginLoader` in svt-cli using `libloading` for dynamic loading (WASM-safe: `libloading` not in svt-core)
- Null-pointer defensive check before `Box::from_raw` in plugin entry point
- 3-tier plugin discovery: `--plugin` CLI flag, `.svt/plugins/`, `~/.svt/plugins/`
- `svt plugin list` subcommand showing loaded plugins and their contributions
- Plugin contributions wired into `svt check` and `svt export` via `register_all()`
- Load failures are non-fatal warnings (stderr), never abort execution

- **Result: 366 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 388 total**

**Not yet done (deferred):** ~~Plugin manifest format (`svt-plugin.toml`), `svt plugin install|remove` commands~~ — resolved in M22. Plugin sandboxing remains as future work. ~~`LanguageOrchestrator` support in plugin API~~ — resolved in M18.

### Milestone 18: Plugin Analyzer Support — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Allow external plugins to contribute language analyzers via the `SvtPlugin` trait.

**Delivered:**
- `LanguageDescriptor` struct in svt-core: language_id, manifest_files, source_extensions, source_dirs, exclude_dirs (WASM-compatible, no platform dependencies)
- `LanguageParser` trait in svt-core: `parse()`, `emit_structural_items()`, `post_process()` with default impls for optional hooks
- `ParseResult` type in svt-core: items, relations, warnings — shared between core and analyzer
- `SvtPlugin::language_parsers()` method returning `Vec<(LanguageDescriptor, Box<dyn LanguageParser>)>` (empty default)
- `DescriptorOrchestrator` in svt-analyzer: generic adapter wrapping any descriptor+parser pair into a `LanguageOrchestrator`
- Go, Python, TypeScript orchestrators refactored to descriptor+parser pattern (factory functions delegating to `DescriptorOrchestrator`)
- `RustAnalyzer` implements `LanguageParser` trait (Rust keeps custom orchestrator for workspace root emission)
- `analyze_project_with_registry()` in svt-analyzer accepts custom `OrchestratorRegistry`
- `PluginLoader::register_language_parsers()` wires plugin contributions into analysis pipeline
- `svt plugin list` shows language parsers with manifest files and source extensions
- Re-exported analysis types (`AnalysisItem`, `AnalysisRelation`, `AnalysisWarning`) from svt-core through svt-analyzer (zero-cost, same types)
- 10 new DescriptorOrchestrator tests, existing 370+ tests all pass
- **Result: 382 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 404 total**
- **Dog-food: 878 nodes, 907 edges, conformance 12/12 passed**

### Milestone 19: Store Persistence & Management — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add persistent storage to the server, schema migrations, store management CLI, and store info API.

**Delivered:**
- Schema version + migration framework: `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `metadata` relation, `schema_version()`, `set_schema_version()`, `migrate()` with forward-only versioning
- `SchemaMismatch` and `CorruptStore` error variants in `StoreError`
- `store_info()` method on `GraphStore` trait with `StoreInfo` and `SnapshotSummary` types (per-snapshot node/edge counts)
- `svt store info` — formatted table with version, kind, nodes, edges, commit, timestamp
- `svt store compact [--keep <versions>]` — default keeps latest design + latest analysis
- `svt store reset [--force]` — delete and recreate store
- Server `--store <PATH>` flag for persistent SQLite-backed CozoDB storage
- Server startup relaxed: `--store` alone is valid if store has existing data
- `GET /api/store/info` endpoint returning JSON store metadata
- 16 new tests (5 schema migration, 3 store_info, 6 CLI store commands, 2 server store endpoint)
- **Result: 398 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 420 total**
- **Dog-food: 852 nodes, 863 edges, conformance 12/12 passed**

### Milestone 20: Incremental Analysis — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Skip re-analysis of unchanged language units by tracking file content hashes per snapshot.

**Delivered:**
- `FileManifestEntry` type in svt-core model (path, hash, unit_name, language)
- `file_manifest` CozoDB relation in `init_schema()` with `(path, version)` key
- `add_file_manifest()`, `get_file_manifest()`, `copy_nodes()`, `copy_edges()` on `GraphStore` trait
- `compact()` updated to clean up file_manifest entries
- BLAKE3 content hashing in `crates/analyzer/src/hashing.rs` (`hash_file`, `build_manifest`, `changed_units`)
- `analyze_project_incremental()` and `analyze_project_incremental_with_registry()` pipeline
- Unit-level skip with copy-then-upsert: copy ALL nodes/edges from previous, then upsert changed units on top
- `AnalysisSummary` extended with `incremental`, `units_skipped`, `units_reanalyzed`, `nodes_copied`, `edges_copied`
- `svt analyze --incremental` CLI flag with auto-detection of latest analysis version
- Falls back to full analysis when no previous version or manifest exists (stores manifest for next run)
- 33 new tests: 10 file_manifest store tests, 13 hashing unit/proptests, 3 incremental pipeline tests, 3 CLI tests, 4 integration tests
- **Result: 431 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 453 total**

**Known limitation (v1):** If a language unit is entirely removed between runs, its ghost nodes remain (copied from previous, never overwritten). Periodic full analysis cleans this up.

### Milestone 21: Analysis Depth — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Improve method call resolution depth through crate-level dependency extraction, Self::/Type:: associated call resolution, and heuristic local variable type inference.

**Delivered:**
- Crate-level `Depends` edges from Cargo metadata: `CrateInfo.workspace_dependencies` populated from `cargo metadata`, `RustOrchestrator.post_process()` emits `Depends` relations between workspace crates
- `resolve_scoped_call()` function: rewrites `Self::method()` to `Type::method()` using impl context, prepends module context for local `Type::method()` calls
- `build_local_type_map()` with `collect_let_declarations()`: walks function bodies for `let` bindings, extracts type from explicit annotations (`let x: Foo`), constructor calls (`let x = Foo::new()`), and struct expressions (`let x = Foo { ... }`)
- `extract_param_types()`: extracts function parameter name→type mappings with `&`/`&mut` reference stripping
- Modified `visit_call_expressions()` to use local type map for receiver type lookup on `x.method()` calls
- Method call resolution statistics: `method_calls_resolved`/`method_calls_unresolved` counters threaded through entire analysis pipeline
- CLI output shows resolution stats: "method calls: N resolved, M unresolved (of T total)"
- 17 new tests (12 unit tests in rust.rs, 2 discovery/orchestrator tests, 3 integration tests)
- **Result: 448 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 470 total**
- **Dog-food: 954 nodes, 1076 edges, 468/3997 method calls resolved (11.7%), conformance 12/12 passed**

**Known limitations:**
- No chained call resolution (`x.foo().bar()` — receiver of `.bar()` is a call expression)
- No field access resolution (`self.field.method()`)
- No trait object/generic resolution (`Box<dyn Foo>`, `fn f<T: Foo>(x: T)`)
- No closure parameter types (`items.iter().map(|x| x.foo())`)
- Import aliasing not handled (`use other::Foo; Foo::new()`)
- Only workspace-internal Cargo dependencies (external crates not represented)

### Milestone 22: Plugin Ecosystem — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add plugin manifest format, install/remove/info CLI commands, manifest-aware loading, and plugin authoring documentation.

**Delivered:**
- `PluginManifest` struct with TOML parsing/validation/serialization (`svt-plugin.toml` format)
- `PluginMetadata` (name, version, description, authors, license, api_version, library) and `PluginContributions` (constraint_kinds, export_formats, language_ids)
- `ManifestError` enum with `thiserror` for structured error reporting
- Platform-aware library filename derivation (`lib<name>.dylib`/`.so`/`.dll`)
- `LoadedPlugin` wrapper pairing plugin instance with path, manifest, and `PluginSource` (CliFlag/ProjectLocal/UserGlobal)
- Sidecar manifest discovery: `<stem>.svt-plugin.toml` then `svt-plugin.toml` in library directory
- `svt plugin install <source> [--global] [--force]` — copies library + manifest to plugins directory
- `svt plugin remove <name> [--global]` — removes plugin by name
- `svt plugin info <path>` — displays manifest metadata with API compatibility check
- Enhanced `svt plugin list` showing source label, manifest description, and contribution details
- Comprehensive plugin authoring guide (`docs/plugin-authoring.md`): Quick Start, trait implementation, contributing types, manifest format, building/installing, testing, API reference, troubleshooting
- 36 new tests (12 manifest, 4 plugin loader, 15 plugin commands, 5 CLI integration)
- **Result: 484 Rust tests + 22 vitest tests = 506 total**
- **Dog-food: conformance 12/12 passed**

**Not yet done (deferred):** Remote plugin registry, plugin dependencies, plugin hot-reloading, plugin configuration/settings, plugin sandboxing.

### Milestone 23: Web UI Enhancements — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add error boundaries with retry, arrow-key graph traversal, and a filtering sidebar.

**Delivered:**
- `ErrorBoundary.svelte` using Svelte 5's `<svelte:boundary>` with `{#snippet failed}` and `{#key retryKey}` for full remount on retry
- Error boundaries wrap GraphView, NodeDetail, and ConformanceReport sections
- Arrow-key graph traversal: Up=parent, Down=first child, Left/Right=prev/next sibling in containment hierarchy
- Pre-computed `TraversalIndex` with O(1) lookups (parentMap, childrenMap, siblingsMap sorted by label)
- `FilterSidebar.svelte`: collapsible left sidebar with checkbox filters for node kind, edge kind, sub-kind, and language
- `filter.svelte.ts` reactive store with `populateFromGraph()`, `resetAll()`, `hasActiveFilters`
- Filters applied client-side via Cytoscape `startBatch()`/`endBatch()` show/hide
- Sidebar state persisted to localStorage, toggled via toolbar button or `g` key
- `*` indicator on filter button when filters are active
- 15 traversal tests + 12 filter logic tests = 27 new vitest tests
- **Result: 484 Rust tests + 49 vitest tests = 533 total**

**Not yet done (deferred):** Provenance filtering (requires adding provenance to Cytoscape graph endpoint), URL hash persistence of filter state, filter count badges, component-level tests with @testing-library/svelte.
